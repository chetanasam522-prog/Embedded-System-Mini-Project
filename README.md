##  Working Principle
The microcontroller controls each hardware component through its I/O ports:
. The DC motor is controlled using a digital output pin for ON/OFF operation.
. The LED is used as a visual indicator.
. The stepper motor rotates in steps based on the control sequence provided by the microcontroller.
. The 7-segment display* shows numeric output using port-based interfacing.
. Software delays are implemented to control timing and sequencing of operations.
