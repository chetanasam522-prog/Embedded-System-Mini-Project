##  Working Principle
The microcontroller controls each hardware component through its I/O ports:
- The DC motor is controlled using a digital output pin for ON/OFF operation.
- The LED is used as a visual indicator.
- The stepper motor rotates in steps based on the control sequence provided by the microcontroller.
- The 7-segment display* shows numeric output using port-based interfacing.
- Software delays are implemented to control timing and sequencing of operations.
